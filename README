X-OpenPanels

This is the x-plane plugin for x-openpanels. This plugin supports writing
the leds on the hardware device by reading different x-plane variables.

You'll find the accompaniing firmware in the x-openpanels-hw project on
github.

This component is very simple, but you'll may use and modify it for your own
needs.

  Software requirements
==============================

 * X-Plane plugin SDK 
     http://www.xsquawkbox.net/xpsdk/mediawiki/Main_Page


  Compile and install
==============================

TrackMii currently does not have autoconfigure. To compile the X-Plane plugin
at the project directory type:

   make all

and hopefully you'll get your plugin at dist/Plugin/GNU-Linux-x86/ named
as openpanels_plugin.xpl

Copy this file to the Resources/plugins/ directory of your X-Plane
installation.
